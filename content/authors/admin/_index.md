I am a data scientist and startup founder with 6+ years' experience delivering end-to-end data analysis and infrastructure projects to multiple $4+ billion clients. Industry background in big data, machine learning systems, NLP and statistics.

Currently, I work on Forecasting Engine at beCloudReady Inc. and use traditional machine learning techniques as well as deep learning. I solve business problems through the broad-based application of data science and creativity. For example, I co-developed a launch sequence (genetic algorithm) for innovative drugs. The solution helps a European pharmaceutic company to maximize product revenue by 17%.
